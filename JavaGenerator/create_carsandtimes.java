/**
 * Created by Sung Kim on 3/2/2016.
 * Create the carsandtimes after reading the single combined file.
 * The carsandtimes is simply each carid with its entry time, its exit time, and its xway.
 * This will be used by carstoreplace to create cars (by removing others) that re-enter the simulation on a different
 * xway sometime later in the simulation.
 * This is important as it prevents easy optimization via the assumption that a car's data can be localized to a single
 * xway-dir.
 *
 * We're only choosing cars that will _potentially_ be re-entrant based on a percentage of the total cars.
 * Thus, if the overlap factor is 10, then ~10% of the cars will be placed into the carsandtimes files.
 *
 * ********************************************************
 * This only creates the carsandtimes NOT the carstoreplace
 * ********************************************************
 * java create_carsandtimes <combined file> <overlap factor: 0 - 100> <carsandtimes_outfile>
