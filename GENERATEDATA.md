# How to generate data files

## Notes
2016-07-26: The toll file is automatically created and cleaned using https://github.com/walmart/LinearGenerator.

2016-07-25: See https://github.com/walmart/LinearGenerator for an updated data generator that only requires Java.  The tolls file would still have to be created and cleaned separately:

`time java historical_tolls <num xways> <max carid> <output file>`

`time java fixtolls <raw toll file> <final_notifications_data> <final toll file>`

2016-03-07: Initially a few cleansing and combination scripts were rewritten in C which yielded tremendous speed benefits.  Run-time for most required steps were halved or reduced to a third of the original time.  Then, the scripts were rewritten in Java (8u73) and surprisingly the performance was even faster.  All the scripts were rewritten in Java.  Now a 250 expressway data set can be combined, modified, and completely prepped in less than 24 hours, potentially 12 hours.  A database is no longer necessary.  Generation of raw data files also no longer requires a database.  Details, scripts, and usage follow below.

For the creation of re-entrant cars, using the previous 0.1 version of the scripts, which was still faster than going to a database, took ~30+ hours to create ~200K replacements from a set of ~780K "carsandtimes" for a 50 expressway dataset.  The newest method will produce the same number of replacements from the same ~780K cars in seconds.

Making the same logic changes to the original Python code would have yielded orders of magnitude benefits in run-times as well.  The Java version will likely still be a constant factor faster, by ~2 to 3x, than the Python version.  

The Java code can be found in the Java directory.

To create the datafiles first download the data generator from http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~linearroad/tools.html and follow the instructions below.

### Using the original generator
To get the original generator working on CentOS6.5/6, or other modern 64-bit Linux distribution, a 32-bit compatibility pack must be installed.  If an older, 32-bit version of Linux is available (i.e. 32-bit CentOS 4.8) that works as well.  Or, one could try rewriting and recompiling the original mitsim program into a 64-bit version. 

Tests on a 64-bit OS (CentOS in Azure) with the 32-bit compatibility pack installed and a 32-bit CentOS 4.8 instance on a local lab machine were both successful.

The general steps for a 64-bit Centos 6.5/6 follow:

Download the original tools and unpack into an arbitrary directory:

```
wget http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~linearroad/files/mitsim.tar.gz
mkdir MITSIMLab
cd MITSIMLab
tar xf ../mitsim.tar.gz
```

Install the 32-bit compatibility pack (for original MITSIM generator to work on 64-bit archs) on CentOS 6.6:
```
sudo yum -y install compat-libstdc++-296.i686
```

Install gcc and make if not already installed.
```
sudo yum -y install gcc make
```
Install the appropriate Perl modules for mitsim.
```
sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install Math::Random"
```
Let CPAN do automatic configuration: [yes] or [Enter].

### Running the original data generator script

(Again, raw file generation can be parallelized by copying mitsim files and folders to any number of machines after modifying the mitsim files.) 
To prepare mitsim for raw data creation edit three files:
`mitsim.config`, `linear-road.pl`, and `Duplicates.pl`.

In `mitsim.config`: change the `directoryforoutput` to a directory of your choosing and select any `numberofexpressways` based on free disk-space (1 xway ~ 1GB).  The only lines necessary are `directoryforoutput` and `numberofexpressways` the rest can be deleted.  

NOTE: remove any trailing blank lines in `mitsim.config` to avoid a Perl `use of uninitialized value` errors from `Duplicates.pl`.

In `linear-road.pl` you have can control a variety of parameters but the only one we adjust is `my $cars_per_hour`, increasing the value to 1000.  `my $endtime` can also be adjusted if shorter or longer simulation times are desired.

In `DuplicateCars.pl`:
1. Remove EVERYTHING (there are quite a few lines) between the lines `close ( PROPERTIES ); ` AND `sub logTime( {` leaving only the lines below and also making the following changes/additions to the respective remaining lines:
  1. add `my $hostname = hostname` after the `close ( PROPERTIES );`
  2. modify the last `rename` line to use `hostname` with an integer suffix (to help with data organization if you're generating on multiple macines) and to rename from `cardatapoints.out$x` : 
2. Add `use Sys::Hostname` to the top of the file
  1. Optionally remove the `use DBI;` line since it is no longer needed.
```
use Sys::Hostname
...
close ( PROPERTIES );

# Add hostname for easier file differentiation
my $hostname = hostname

# You don't need a database to create raw files!

#Full expressway Loop (generates an extra one for half).
for( my $x=0; $x < $numberOfExpressways; $x++){
        # run linear road
        writeToLog ( $logfile, $logvar, "Linear road run number: $x");
        system ("perl linear-road.pl --dir=$dir");
        rename( $dir."/cardatapoints.out.debug" , $dir."/cardatapoints$x.out.debug" );
        rename( $dir."/$cardatapoints" , $dir."/$hostname$x" );
}

sub logTime {
...
```
NOTE: if SELinux is present it may need to be disabled: `sudo setenforce 0`

To kick off the script `./run mitsim.config`.

Depending on the endtime (in `linear-road.pl`) and number of expressways chosen (in `mitsim.config`) the raw data file generator can run for hours, if not days or more.  Each 3 hour 1 expressway (with 1000 cars/hours/seg) raw file can take ~3-5 hours to generate.  So, it's best to set generation on multiple small machines and let them run unattended.  Just ensure that your target directory has enough space to hold the raw data files.  Currently, 25 separate small VM's (Azure A1's) with a +60GB data disk each were able to each create and hold 50 expressways.

The raw data files will be found under the `directoryforoutput` as configured in `mitsim.config` as n files named `$hostname`n.  n being 0 .. `numberofexpressways`-1.

The original script `DuplicateCars.pl` handled the process of combining the multiple raw data files along with creating re-entrants and the toll file but it could not handle, in a reasonable amount of time, large numbers of expressways.  The self-join query mentioned in the general introduction explains one of the bottlenecks--the progressive slowdown of the self-join query that finds re-entrants.

Everything after raw file creation was re-written, along with the addition of some data cleansing steps.  Python was used first.  Then C and Java.  Java (8u73) turned out to be the fastest for these scripts.

### Creating a single combined data file
As stated in the README, datasets of arbitrary sizes can be generated on a single machine or by parallelizing the expressway generation on multiple machines.  But, after generation, these must be cleaned (if desired) and combined.  

**These are the scripts and commands used for cleaning raw files--run on the individual raw files.  (Any number of additional steps can be added as desired.)**

```
time java dataval <raw_file> <temp_outfile>
time java datarm2 <temp_outfile> <temp_outfile2>  # remove carids with only <=2 tuples
time java datamakeexit <temp_outfile2> <temp_outfile3>  # make the last type 0 record an exit lane tuple
mv <temp_outfile3> <clean_file>
```
The raw files above can be cleansed in parallel on n machines.

On each machine, or a single machine, place the raw files in a new directory and from the directory with the Java classes run:
```
for f in $(ls <dir_of_raw_files>) ; do time java dataval $f t1 ; time java datarm2 t1 t2 ; time java datamakeexit t2 t3 ; mv t3 $f.clean ; done
```
Use absolute paths.

After cleaning move all the clean files into a new directory to merge the n "clean" files.
```
time java datacombine  <dir_of_cleaned_files> <outfile (combined_cleaned_file)>
```
The above command will emit the maximum carid which is needed to create the historical tolls file.

Then create the historical toll file and the random re-entrant cars.

Create the toll file.
```
time java historical_tolls <numxways> <maxcarid> <outfile (raw_toll_file)>
```
NOTE: a 'number of expressways == 3' for historical_tolls will yield xways from 0 - 2

The finding of re-entrants, which was previously the slowest step, now happens in minutes.
The first step creates the carsandtimes table originally performed in a database.  This version of making the carsandtimes table, finding replacements, and making replacements is much, much faster than the database-dependent original or logic+scripts from v0.1.  The overlap is set to 10 (it can be more or less) and determines the percentage of cars to use as the candidate pool for potentially re-entrant cars.

Create the carsandtimes table.
```
time java create_carsandtimes <infile (clean_combined_file)> <overlap> <outfile (cars_and_times)>
```
Create the carstoreplace file.  (This step only took minutes for a 250 expressway set.)
```
time java create_carstoreplace (infile (cars_and_times)> <outfile (cars_to_replace)> <numxways>
```
Now perform the actual replacements.  Again, no database necessary, but we split into n xway separate files so we can time order into a single file later.  The output is n xway files named `replaced.part-N` using the outfile prefix, a dash, and an int.
```
time java replacecars <infile (cars_to_replace)> <infile (clean_combined_file)> <outfile prefix (i.e. replacedprefix)>
```
Move files to a new directory to hold the n individual xways.
```
mkdir temp
mv replaced.part* temp/ ; 
```
Combine the n parts into a single, time-ordered file.
```
time java combine_after_replace temp/ <outfile (final_data_file)>
```
Finally, clean the generated tolls to match the tuples present in the position reports.
```
time java fixtolls <infile (raw_toll_file)> <infile (final_data_file)> <outfile (final_toll_file)>
```
Make sure you have enough space on your hard drives to handle all files and temp files.  Each xway will generate ~1GB of position data and ~300MB of toll data.  Using multiple disks is recommended for temp and final file output.  I.e. for a 250 xway set: 250 GB for individual clean files, 250GB for the combined clean file, 82-87GB for the raw toll file, 250GB for the split replaced parts, 250GB for the final file, and 82-87GB for the final toll file for a total of roughly 1.5 TB of free space to generate a 250 xway set without deleting intermediate files.

All the commands (after having a directory of cleaned files) can be combined into a single-line bash call as shown below.
`datadrive` and `datadrive2` are my data directories.
NOTE: I set an env variable to hold eventually hold the maxcarid, `cd` into the directory containing the Java class files, and use full paths for all files and directories.
```
maxcarid=0 ; cd /datadrive/java/LRDataGen/out/production/LRDataGen/ ; \
time maxcarid=$(java datacombine /datadrive/tmp_clean /datadrive2/3.combined) ; \
time java historical_tolls 3 $maxcarid /datadrive2/3.tolls.raw ; \
time java create_carsandtimes /datadrive2/3.combined 10 /datadrive2/3.carsandtimes ; \
time java create_carstoreplace /datadrive2/3.carsandtimes /datadrive2/3.carstoreplace 3 ; \
time java replacecars /datadrive2/3.carstoreplace /datadrive2/3.combined /datadrive2/3.replaced.part ; \
mkdir /datadrive2/3.temp ; \
mv /datadrive2/3.replaced.part* /datadrive2/3.temp ; \
time java combine_after_replace /datadrive2/3.temp /datadrive/3h3x.dat ; \
time java fixtolls /datadrive2/3.tolls.raw /datadrive/3h3x.dat /datadrive/3h3x.tolls.dat
```
